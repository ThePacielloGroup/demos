<p>It's important that however a control or link receives &quot;attention&quot; from the user, a clear indication of this focus should be given.  Changing the appearance of elements on mouse hover is very common, but keyboard focus should also be taken into consideration, because people may be navigating about your site via the keyboard alone.</p>

<p>In most cases, ensuring equal access for keyboard users is as simple as ensuring that wherever you have <code>:hover</code> in your CSS, you also have <code>:focus</code>.</p>

<p>Please note that <a href="/articles/focus-indication">focus indication must be clearly visible</a>.</p>
