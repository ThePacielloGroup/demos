<p>In terms of WCAG AA, there is no prescribed contrast ratio for buttons, however there is a requirement for the focus indication to be 'visible'.  We recommend the following.</p>

<ul>
	<li>A consistent indication across all focusable elements, including at least an outline style.</li>
	<li>Outline must be at least 2px thick.</li>
	<li>Outline must have 3:1 colour contrast against focused element, Or have an outline-offset gap between focused element of at least 1px.</li>
	<li>Outline must have 3:1 contrast between whatever background it's placed on.</li>
</ul>

<p>It is important to bear in mind that browsers' default focus indication is often insufficient because it is either too weak to contrast against the background (bear in mind that a dashed outline has significantly less contrast than a solid one).</p>

<p>Also, if you are relying on subtle changes of colour to indicate changes in state for buttons, these may not be visible on certain types of display or in certain environmental/lighting conditions, so either making the colour change more striking, or having an additional (e.g. outline) focus indicator can be of great help.</p>

<p>Please note that any changes to elements that are applied on hover <a href="{{ BASE }}/articles/hover-and-focus-as-equals">should also be applied on focus</a>.</p>
